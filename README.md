# XSS-Detection

I've used the requests,html and Beautiful soup libraries ,where Beautiful soup is used to parse the HTML content

which is fetched using the requests module and finally the code is optimized with the help of ThreadPoolExecutor class

that is imported from concurrent.futures module that helped to parellelize the testing of payloads on different fields.
